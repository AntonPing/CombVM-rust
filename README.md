# Zen of Norem
Beautiful is better than ugly,  
but being ugly is sometime unavoidable.  

Explicit is better than implicit,  
but too explicit leaks the abstraction.  

Simple is better than complex.  
but complex is the real world programming.  

Nested is good, it reminds you what recursion is.  
Flat is also good, it reminds you what sequential means.  
Sparse or dense? that's a problem.  
It all depends on readability.  

Special cases are important, more importantly,  
try to change you model to avoid special cases.  
Practicality beats purity, but still,  
don't give up seeking the truth.  

In the face of ambiguity, swear to the guy who wrote it.  
If you found one -- and only one -- obvious way to do it.  
Probobaly your problem is too trivial. Just use python.  

If you think too much, stop and start coding.  
If you code too much, slow down and keep thinking.  

If the implementation is hard to explain, you are still far away from the truth.  
If the implementation is easy to explain, GREAT!!!  
Now you need to do is try to make it harder to explain!
